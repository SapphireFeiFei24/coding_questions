# Constraints Matters

Before you start working on any solution, you should check the constraints first.
Usually this will give you a pretty strong hints on what might be the data struction/approach you want to use.

For example, when you see that 1 < n < 10^5, that means you might want to consider only the solutions that have lower than O(NlogN) complexity.

**A solution that has 10^10 complexity can lead to a TLE**
